Mission goal
============

This file or one of its more complex variants (refer to the documentation) is
required.

It is displayed in its entirety by the command
  $ gsh goal
It should describe the goal of the mission.


Useful commands
===============

gsh check
  Checks that the missions has been completed.

# This file is not required: it is sourced every time the mission is started.

#
# Since it is sourced, it may define environment variables if you really need

#
# Note however that should the mission be initialized in a subshell, those
# environment variables will disappear! That typically happens a mission is
# checked using process redirection, as in
#   $ SOMETHING | gsh check
# To mitigate the problem, GameShell will display a message asking the player
# to run
#   $ gsh reset
