# this script should be sourced with the command to monitor as argument
# it depends on arguments being passed to a sourced script, which is not
# the case in POSIX, but does work in bash or zsh
# one way to use with a POSIX shell is to do set ARGV manually with
#    $ set -- COMMAND TO MONITOR
#    $ . progress_bar.sh COMMAND TO MONITOR
#
# NOTE: it can be executed as well, but the given command will be executed in
# a subshell, so the environment might be different
