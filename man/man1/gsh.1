.SH "NAME"
gsh \- GameShell specific commands invocation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBgsh\fR <\fICOMMAND\fR>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
GameShell is a game for learning (and teaching) how to use a POSIX shell\&.
.sp
Almost all the commands encountered during a game are standard Unix commands, with the notable exception of the commands needed to interact with GameShell itself\&. All those interaction start with \fBgsh\fR, followed by a subcommand\&.
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
On standard Unix systems, you should be able to quit this manual by pressing the "q" key\&.
.sp
You should be able to scroll using the Space key or the arrow keys\&.
.sp
You can search through this page by pressing on the "/" key, followed by the pattern you are searching\&. Pressing "n" (for "next") or "p" (for "previous") will jump to the next / previous occurrence of the search pattern\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"

Under normal circumstances, a player shouldn\(cqt need to use more than the following commands\&.
.PP
\fBgsh check\fR
.RS 4

.sp
Some commands are only accessible when the player knows the secret "GameShell administrator password"\&. Those commands make it possible to skip missions\&.

.RS 4
give up on the current mission and go to the next one

(no password necessary if the mission was completed at least once)
