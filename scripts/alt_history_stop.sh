#
# this script, together with its companion alt_history_start.sh is used to record
# manually commands in a temporary history
# This is used to test missions that require inputing specific commands.
# It works with bash and zsh.
#
# To use, **source** alt_history_start.sh. This will start a separate history.
# Use the function add_cmd to add commands to the history.
# When you're done, **source** alt_history_stop.sh to go back to the original
# history.
