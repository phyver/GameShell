Welcome to GameShell!

Using and administering a computer running a Unix-like operating 
system (e.g., Linux, BSD or macOS) requires using a command line 
interface called "shell". In this game you will learn how to use 
the shell by journeying through various missions that will teach 
you to perform standard tasks such as:
  - creating directories,
  - creating, viewing and editing files,
  - searching for files satisfying certain criteria,
  - running and interrupting programs,
  - etc.

During your adventure you will need to visit locations, interact 
with people, and find various objects. However, you have to keep 
in mind that these are standard directories, programs, and files 
(often with random contents). So, for example:
  - "build a hut" means creating a directory called "Hut", and
  - "put a coin in your chest" means moving a file called "coin" 
    to a directory called "Chest".
