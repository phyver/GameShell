Welcome to GameShell

During a game of GameShell, you will receive "missions" that 
correspond to standard tasks one may have while using or 
administering a computer:

  - create directories,
  - create ou visualise files,
  - search for files that satisfy simple or complex criteria,
  - run or stop programs,
  - etc.

The "things" you will meet are simply standard files (often with 
some random content) and the "places" you will visit are simply 
directories.
So, "build a cabin" amounts to creating a directory called "Cabin", 
and "put the coins in your chest" amounts to moving the files called 
"coin" into the directory called "Chest".
