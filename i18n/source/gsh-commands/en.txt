NAME
----
gsh - GameShell specific commands invocation

SYNOPSIS
--------
**gsh** <__COMMAND__>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
GameShell is a game for learning (and teaching) how to use a POSIX shell.

Almost all the commands encountered during a game are standard Unix commands,
with the notable exception of the commands needed to interact with GameShell
itself. All those interaction start with **gsh**, followed by a subcommand.

NOTE
----
On standard Unix systems, you should be able to quit this manual by pressing
the "q" key.

You should be able to scroll using the Space key or the arrow keys.

You can search through this page by pressing on the "/" key, followed by the
pattern you are searching. Pressing "n" (for "next") or "p" (for "previous")
will jump to the next / previous occurrence of the search pattern.

COMMANDS
--------
Standard player commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under normal circumstances, a player shouldn't need to use more than the
following commands.

**gsh check**::
	check whether the current mission's goal has been 
	achieved or not

**gsh exit**::
	quit GameShell +
	Note that you can exit GameShell using Control-d as well

**gsh goal** [__N__]::
	show the current mission's goal +
	if __N__ is given, show the goal for mission __N__

**gsh help**::
	short help message

**gsh reset**::
	reset the current mission

Admin commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some commands are only accessible when the player knows the secret "GameShell
administrator password". Those commands make it possible to skip missions.

The password for the standard GameShell is simply "gsh" but if you're using
GameShell in the classroom, your instructor has probably changed it to
something else!

**gsh auto**::
	source the current mission's automatic script, if it exists

**gsh goto** [__N__]::
	directly go to mission __N__ +
	(Note: no password necessary if __N__ is an earlier mission)

**gsh skip**::
	give up on the current mission and go to the next one +
	(no password necessary if the mission was completed at least 
	once)

Additional commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a couple of additional commands that can give information about the
game. Except for the **index** subcommand, they aren't very interesting for
the player.

**gsh index**::
	show list of missions, with their status

**gsh stat**::
	display simple statistics about completed missions

**gsh version**::
	show GameShell's version

**gsh welcome**::
	show the welcome message

Developer and administration commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following commands are only useful for GameShell developers. Player
should probably avoid them.

**gsh assert condition** [__MSG__]::
	check if the condition is true +
	if not, display an error message

**gsh assert check true/false** [__MSG__]::
	check the current mission's goal has been achieved +
	if the result doesn't coincide with the expected result, display 
	an error message

**gsh env**::
	display internal environment variables

**gsh hardreset**::
	reset the current mission by restarting the shell

**gsh HELP**::
	show advanced usage status, with all existing Gameshell commands

**gsh log** [**-v**]::
	show the log file of gsh commands

**gsh pcm**::
	print the current mission number

**gsh protect** and **gsh unprotect**::
	add / remove protection on GameShell directories

**gsh resetstatic**::
	regenerate all the static parts of the world

**gsh save** __FILENAME__::
	save the current game to file

**gsh systemconfig**::
	display the system configuration

**gsh test**::
	run the current mission's test script, if it exists
