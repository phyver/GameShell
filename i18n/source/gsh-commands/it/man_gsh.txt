gsh(1)
======

NAME
----
gsh - GameShell specific commands invocation

SYNOPSIS
--------
**gsh** <__COMMAND__>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
GameShell is a game for learning (and teaching) how to use a POSIX shell.

Almost all the commands encountered during a game are standard Unix commands,
with the notable exception of the commands needed to interact with GameShell
itself. All those interaction start with **gsh**, followed by a subcommand.

NOTE
----
On standard Unix systems, you should be able to quit this manual by pressing
the "q" key.

You should be able to scroll using the Space key or the arrow keys.

You can search through this page by pressing on the "/" key, followed by the
pattern you are searching. Pressing "n" (for "next") or "p" (for "previous")
will go the next / previous occurrence of the search pattern.

COMMANDS
--------
Standard player commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under normal circumstances, a player shouldn't need to use more than the
following commands.

INCLUDE it/commands_standard.txt

Admin commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some commands are only accessible when the player knows the secret "GameShell
administrator password". Those commands make it possible to skip some mission.

The password for the standard GameShell is simply "gsh" but if you're using
GameShell in the classroom, your instructor has probably changed it to
something else!

INCLUDE it/commands_admin.txt

Additional commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are couple of additional commands that can give information about the
game. Except for the **index** subcommand, they aren't very interesting for
the player.

INCLUDE it/commands_misc.txt

Developer and administration commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following commands are only useful for GameShell developers. Player
should probably avoid them.

INCLUDE it/commands_dev.txt
