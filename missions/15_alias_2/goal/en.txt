Mission goal
============

Create an alias 'journal' in order to easily edit your 
journal file wherever you are.


Details
-------

To edit the journal file from the cellar, or the throne 
room with `nano`, you need to give the full path to the 
file: "!/Forest/...../journal.txt"

To avoid typing this long command each time, you can 
create an alias like with

  alias la='ls -a'

as previously seen.


Useful commands
===============

  nano FILE
    edit the file from the terminal
    (If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.)

  alias NAME='CMD'
    NAME is a (small) string that will be replaced by 
    the (longuer) string CMD
