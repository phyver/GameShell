Mission goal
============

Create an alias "journal" in order to easily edit your journal 
file wherever you are.


Details
-------

To edit the journal file with ``nano`` from, for example, the 
cellar or the throne room, you need to give the full path to 
the file: "~/Forest/...../journal.txt".

To avoid typing this long command each time, you can create an 
alias as we saw with 

  alias la='ls -a'

in a previous mission.


Useful commands
===============

nano FILE
  Edit the FILE from the shell.
  (If the file does not exist, it will be created.)

alias NAME='CMD'
  Create a command with a short name NAME to stand for the 
  longer command CMD.
