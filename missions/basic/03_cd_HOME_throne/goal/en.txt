Mission goal
============

Go back to the starting location and then go to the throne room 
using only two commands.

Remark
------

You may experiment with as many commands as you want, but
to validate the mission the following conditions need to be met:
  - the second to last command takes you to the starting point,
  - the last command takes you directly to the throne room.


Useful commands
===============

cd
  Move back to the starting location.

cd LOCATION1/LOCATION2/LOCATION3
  Make several moves in one command.


Remark
------

UPPERCASE words appearing in commands are meta-variables: you need 
to replace them by appropriate (string) values.
