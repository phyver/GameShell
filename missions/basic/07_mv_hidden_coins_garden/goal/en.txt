Mission goal
============

Collect all the coins hidden in the garden in front of the castle, 
and put them in your chest (in your hut in the forest).


Secondary objective
-------------------

Learn how to use the "Tab" key to go faster.


Useful commands
===============

ls -A
  List all the files of the current directory, including hidden 
  files. (A file is "hidden" when its name starts with a dot.)

Tab
  The tabulation key "completes" the name of a file or directory 
  once you have typed the beginning of its name. This only works
  if there is only one possible completion.

Tab-Tab
  Pressing tabulation twice successively shows a list of possible 
  completions.
