Mission goal
============

The tapestries in the castle's entrance are also particularly 
beautiful. Since you can't just take them, put a copy of each 
in your chest.


Shell patterns
==============

*
  The "*" character stands in for any sequence of characters
  (including an empty sequence).

?
  The "?" character stands in for any single character.

Those wildcards can be used to denote lists of existing files / 
directories

For example: if the current folder contains
      file-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
then
    *     -->  file-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
    *1    -->  file-1 Folder-1
    *o*   -->  Folder-1 potato
    x*    -->  error, no matching file
    *-?   -->  file-1 Folder-1
    *-??  -->  file-14
