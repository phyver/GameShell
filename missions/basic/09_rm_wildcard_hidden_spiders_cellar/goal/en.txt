The spiders are getting clever: they found a way to hide.
Get rid of all the spiders that are hiding in the cellar without 
disturbing the bats.


Shell patterns
==============

*
  The "*" character stands in for any sequence of characters
  (including an empty sequence).

explicit dot at the start of the pattern.
