Mission goal
============

At the back of the cellar, there is a small opening going to the 
spider queen's lair.
Go there, and remove the spider queen (and nothing else).


Note: you have a limited amount of time (20 seconds) to do that. You 
can use the command ``gsh reset`` to reset the timer.

Another thing: shell patterns have been deactivated. You cannot use 
the wildcards ``*`` or ``?``.


Useful commands
===============

Tab
  The "Tabulation" key completes the name of a file or directory 
  once you have typed the beginning of its name. This only works
  if there is only one possible completion.

Tab-Tab
  Pressing the "Tabulation" key twice successively shows a list of 
  possible completions.
