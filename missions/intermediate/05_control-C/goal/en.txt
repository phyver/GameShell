Mission goal
============

The wizard Merlin appears next to you and asks for your help. 
You need to whisper the magic word
  $ $command
to put him into a trance so that he can remember a special 
incantation for creating fireworks.

The only problem is that after a couple of seconds in a trance, 
Merlin falls asleep! You thus need to interrupt him whenever 
that's the case, so that he can try again.


NOTE: it will probably take several tries before Merlin 
actually remembers the incantation


Useful commands
===============

$command
  this (non standard) command puts Merlin into a trance

Control-c       (also written ^c)
  pressing Control and c at the same times interrupts the current command 
  by sending the INT ("INTerrupt") signal to the process
