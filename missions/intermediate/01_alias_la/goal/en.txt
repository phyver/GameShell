Mission goal
============

Checking for hidden files is taking too long!

Create an alias "la" to run the command ``ls -A`` in order to list 
all files, including hidden ones, with only 2 letters.

Define the synonym

  la='ls -A'

and check that it works as expected.

How fortunate, there is a nice rock hidden just where you are.


Useful commands
===============

alias STRING='COMMAND'
  Create a synonym for a short string, that will stand for a longer 
  command.
