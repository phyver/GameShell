Mission goal
============

Create an alias "journal" in order to easily edit your journal 
file wherever you are.


Details
-------

To edit the journal file with ``nano`` from, for example, the 
cellar or the throne room, you need to give the full path to the 
file: "~/Forest/.../journal.txt".

To avoid typing this long command each time, you can create an alias 
just like

  alias la='ls -a'


Useful commands
===============

nano FILE
  Edit the file from the shell.
  (If the file does not exist, it will be created.)

alias STRING='COMMAND'
  Create a synonym for a short string, that will stand for a longer 
  command.
