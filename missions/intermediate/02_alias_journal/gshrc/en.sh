# This file is loaded (or "sourced" in shell jargon) when the game
# starts. You can use it to record aliases (and also other things)
# that you may want to keep across game sessions. Indeed, an alias
# defined in the shell will be "forgotten" if it is not added here
# (aliases defined as part of missions are recorded for you).
#
# Remark: all lines starting with '#' in this file are ignored.
# Standard shell use such files, usually hidden in the home
# directory. For bash, the file is found at the path
#       ~/.bashrc
# and the one for zsh at
#       ~/.zshrc
# (Do not modify those files as they are used by GameShell!)

# Whenever you edit this file, the definitions it contains are not
# directly added to the current shell. You can however rely on the
# following alias to do that for you.
alias reload="source ~/.gshrc"

# Here are a few alias ideas for you:
# - an alias "gg" for "gsh goal",
# - an alias "gc" for "gsh check",
# - an alias "editrc" to edit this file with nano.
