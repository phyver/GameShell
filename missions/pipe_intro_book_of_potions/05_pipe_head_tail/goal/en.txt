Mission goal
============

The old hermit is thirsty and he would like you lookup the recipe 
for distilled water.

To validate the mission, your last command prior to ``gsh check`` 
must show the steps for the recipe and nothing else.


Useful commands
===============

head [-n K] [FILE]
  Print the first lines (10 by default, K if ``-n K`` is used) of 
  the given file, or standard input if no file is given.

tail [-n K] [FILE]
  Print the last lines (10 by default, K if ``-n K`` is used) of 
  the given file, or standard input if no file is given.

COMMAND1  |  COMMAND2
  Run the two commands, feeding the "standard output" of the 
  former into the "standard input" of the latter.
  Remark: by analogy with plumbing "|" is called "pipe".


Remark
------

Parts in [square brackets] in command descriptions are stand for 
optional parts. The brackets are not part of the command.
