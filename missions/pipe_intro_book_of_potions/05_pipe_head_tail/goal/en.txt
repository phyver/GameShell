Mission goal
============

The old hermit is thirsty and he would like you lookup the recipe 
for distilled water.

In order to validate the mission, you need to be in the cave with 
Servillus **and** your last command prior to ``gsh check`` must show 
the steps for the recipe and nothing else.

Note: you shouldn't alter the content of the book of potions.


Useful commands
===============

head [-n K] [FILE]
  Print the first lines (10 by default, K if ``-n K`` is used) of 
  the given file, or standard input if no file is given.

tail [-n K] [FILE]
  Print the last lines (10 by default, K if ``-n K`` is used) of 
  the given file, or standard input if no file is given.

COMMAND1  |  COMMAND2
  Run the two commands, feeding the "standard output" of the 
  former into the "standard input" of the latter.
  Remark: by analogy with plumbing "|" is called "pipe".


Remark
------

Parts in [square brackets] in command descriptions are stand for 
optional parts. The brackets are not part of the command.
