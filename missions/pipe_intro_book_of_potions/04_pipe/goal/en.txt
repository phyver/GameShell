Mission goal
============

The old hermit notices your interest for potion recipes, and sees 
promise in your ability to lookup lists of ingredients. He 
challenges you to find the steps for the elixir of Youth.

In order to validate the mission, your last command prior to ``gsh 
check`` must show the steps for the recipe and nothing else.


Useful commands
===============

cat FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEn
  Display the contents of the files in order.

tail
  Print the last 10 lines sent on the standard input.

tail -n K
  Print the last K lines sent on the standard input.

COMMAND1  |  COMMAND2
  Run the two commands, feeding the "standard output" of the 
  former into the "standard input" of the latter.
  Remark: by analogy with plumbing "|" is called "pipe".


Explanations
============

Many of Unix commands process text: they receive text as input and 
produce text as output.

It is common for those commands to write their output to their 
"standard output", which means that (by default) the output is 
written into the terminal.

Most of those commands can receive input either through files (given 
as arguments) or from their "standard input". For example:
- ``head FILE`` reads its input from the file,
- ``head`` reads its input on the standard input.

By default, data from the standard input is read from the keyboard, 
but a pipe can change that.
