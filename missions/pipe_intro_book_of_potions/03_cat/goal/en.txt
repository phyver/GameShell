Mission goal
============

While cleaning the dishes, Servillus mentions an interesting potion 
that lets the drinker (temporarily) take the physical appearance of 
anyone.
Read the recipe of the potion from the hermit's book.

In order to validate the mission, you need to be in the cave with 
Servillus **and** your last command prior to ``gsh check`` must show 
the whole recipe (with its title).


Useful commands
===============

cat FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEn
  Display the contents of the files in order.
  Remark: ``cat`` is an abbreviation for "concatenate".
