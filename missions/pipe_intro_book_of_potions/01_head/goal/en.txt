Mission goal
============

A forgetful old hermit called Servillus has set up camp in a cave 
with his old, leather-bound potion book.
Go to the cave and help him remember the recipe of his famous herbal 
tea.

In order to validate the mission, your last command prior to 
``gsh check`` must show the recipe (including its title), but 
nothing else.
