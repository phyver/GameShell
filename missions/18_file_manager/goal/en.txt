Mission goal
============

Find the copper coin in the (small) maze at the end of the corridor 
hidden in the cellar, and move it to your chest.

You can, if you want, use a graphical file manager.
The maze can be found in
  $maze

(Don't forget to make sure the file manager displays hidden files!)
