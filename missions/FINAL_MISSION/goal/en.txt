Congratulations!

You have finished all the missions.

You can now quit GameShell, or go back to some old missions.

Use ``gsh HELP`` to get a list of all GameShell commands.
The commands ``gsh index`` and ``gsh goto N`` are particularly 
interesting.

Note: the admin password has been changed to '$password'.
