Mission goal
============

A secret message has been found, it is kept in the drawer in 
Merlin's office. It was probably enciphered using a Caesar shift 
cipher.

Decrypt it by making an exhaustive search from the command line.

Hint
----

All other secret messages that have been found were using a shift 
between 10 and 16.


Useful commands
===============

tr STRING1 STRING2
  Replace each character STRING1[i] by STRING2[i] on the standard 
  input, and output the result.
  Remark: ``tr`` is an abbreviation for "translate".

  Example: if
      CHAINE1 = "abcdef"
      CHAINE2 = "klmnop"
  the file will be output with the following substitution (other 
  characters are left unchanged)
      a -> k      b -> l      c -> m
      d -> n      e -> o      f -> p

  Note: instead of "abcdefg", it is possible to write "a-g".

  This command is particularly useful with a redirection ``<``.
