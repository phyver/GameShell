Mission goal
============

Merlin's old spell books are kept in his office, in the library. You 
need to save a list of all those spell books (and nothing else) in a 
file called "inventory.txt", in the drawer...


Useful commands
===============

COMMAND  >  FILE
  Send the command's output to a file instead of printing it on the 
  screen.

less FILE
  display the content of a file, one page at a time

  Important keybindings are
    q         quit
    Space     scroll down one page
    / STRING  search for a string
    n         go to the next occurrence of the search string
