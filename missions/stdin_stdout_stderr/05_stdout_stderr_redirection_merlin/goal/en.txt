Mission goal
============

Merlin has turned crazy... He paces around the observatory tower and 
mumbles incoherently.

You need to make sense of this because he is the only one who knows 
the secret key!

Hint
----

It is likely that Merlin's message is riddled with errors.


Useful commands

  is executable...
