Mission goal
============

Merlin has turned crazy... He paces around the observatory tower and 
mumbles incoherently.

You need to filter out his ramblings to discover the secret key he 
is the only one to know.

Hint
----

It is likely that Merlin's message is riddled with errors.
To complete this mission, you have to give the secret key **using a 
file redirection**.


Useful commands
===============

./FILE
  Run an executable file as a program. Needless to say that Merlin 
  is executable...

COMMAND  >  FILE
  Send standard output (stdout) for the command to a file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

COMMAND  2>  FILE
  Send error output (stderr) for the command to a file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

COMMAND  <  FILE
  Send the file to the standard input (stdin) of the command.
