Mission goal
============

Merlin has turned crazy... He paces around the observatory tower and 
mumbles incoherently.

You need to make sense of this because he is the only one who knows 
the secret key!

Hint
----

It is likely that Merlin's message is riddled with errors.
To complete this mission, you have to give the secret key **using a 
file redirection**.


Useful commands
===============

./FILE
  Run an executable file as a program. Needless to say that Merlin 
  is executable...

COMMAND  >  FILE
  Send standard output (stdout) for the command to a file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

COMMAND  2>  FICHIER
  Send error output (stderr) for the command to a file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

COMMAND  <  FILE
  Send the file to the standard input (stdin) of the command.
