Mission goal
============

Merlin's old alchemy books are kept in his office, in the library. 
You need to output a list of all the books containing the alchemical 
compound 'gsh' (for "Glutathione").
Beware, it can be spelled with a mix of letters in upper and 
lowercase.

Some of those books are locked, and you are not allowed to consult 
them. Ignore them.

Remark
------

Only the list of books is required. The chemical compounds should 
not be shown on the screen.


Useful commands
===============

grep STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  Search for a string inside a file and print the corresponding 
  lines.
  Some interesting options are
    -l : do not print the lines, but only the filenames containing
         the string
    -i : do not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase

COMMAND  >  FILE
  Send messages (stdout) to the file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

COMMAND  2>  FICHIER
  Send error messages (stderr) to the file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

/dev/null
  "Virtual" file that is universally empty: anything sent to it is 
  disappears.

Explanations
------------

Every command can output messages to the screen in two ways:
  - standard printing ("stdout")
  - error printing ("stderr")
By default, both kind of messages are show on the screen.

It is however possible to redirect both of them to files 
independently.
