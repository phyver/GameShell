Mission goal
============

Merlin's old spell books are kept in his office, in the library. You 
need to output a list of all the spell books containing the 
incantation "pq" (or "Pq", or "pQ", or "PQ").

Some of those spell books are locked, and you are not allowed to 
consult them. You need to ignore them.

Remark
------

Only the list of spell books is required. The incantation should not 
be printed on the screen.


Useful commands
===============

grep STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  Search for a string inside a file and print the corresponding 
  lines.
  Some interesting options are
    -l : do not print the lines, but only the filenames containing
         the string
    -i : do not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase

COMMAND  >  FILE
  Send messages (stdout) to the file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

COMMAND  2>  FICHIER
  Send error messages (stderr) to the file.
  (The file is overwritten.)

/dev/null
  "Virtual" file that is universally empty: anything sent to it is 
  disappears.

Explanations
------------

Every command can output messages to the screen in two ways:
  - standard printing ("stdout")
  - error printing ("stderr")
By default, both kind of messages are show on the screen.

It is however possible to redirect both of them to files 
independently.
