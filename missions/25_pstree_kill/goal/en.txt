Mission goal
============

The rats have found a friend named Linguini, who installed some 
device to distribute morsels of cheese in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, the chef, Skinner, installed some machines that 
disseminate rat poison.

Kill the rat poison generators, but keep the cheese generators.
Then, remove all the rat poison from the cellar.

NOTE: do not kill Linguini or Felix.
