Mission goal
============

Merlin's old spell books are kept in his office, in the library. You 
need to save a list of all those spell books (and nothing else) in a 
file called "inventory.txt", in the drawer...


Useful commands
===============

CMD  >  FILE
  the output of the command is sent to the file instead of being 
  printed on the standard output (the screen)

less FILE
  display the content of a text file, one page at a time

  Important keybindings are
    Space     scroll down one page
    q         quit
    / STRING  search the string in the file
    n         go to the next occurrence of the last search string
