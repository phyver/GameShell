Thus ends the epic of the colonies of Esdea and Esdebe.
From the ethereal lands discovered by geo-mantic cartographers,
to villages transformed into administered provinces, to the proclamation
of independence and the founding of the **Union of Autonomous Settlements (USA)**,
you have accompanied each step, each decree and each bureaucratic absurdity.

You have seen explorers settle, villages grow, quotas fall,
disasters strike and administrators get tangled in their own registers.
You have frozen entire kingdoms, repaired collapsed mountains,
and even prepared an astral teleportation before reason (and commerce)
brought everyone back to the negotiating table.

The peace treaty is now signed.
The kingdom of **Bordereau VI The Stamped** and the USA again exchange their goods, their knowledge and their Friday fries. The colonists resume their lives, markets fill up,
and the royal officials, reassured, have already created three new royal offices:
one responsible for "supervising the application of the treaty", another for watching over "the balance of trade balance", and the third for "control of imports and exports of goods and services".
For their part, the USA has equipped itself with two permanent parliamentary commissions:
one dedicated to "maintaining attentive vigilance on the application of international commitments",
the other to "ensuring compliance with import rules", as well as a federal agency
specially mandated for "surveillance of extraterritorial issues", the "New Surveillance of Extraterritorial Affairs" (NSA).

Suddenly, you feel a doubt rising in you:
the big mustachioed gentleman from the imports commission, there,
and the little hunched one from the NSA... their faces remind you of something.
Hadn't you already met them at the Christmas party
of the Royal Bureau of Arbitrary Stochastic Classifications? And there on the desk of the "First secretary for current affairs", wouldn't that be a stamp holder?

and do gsh when you're done!
