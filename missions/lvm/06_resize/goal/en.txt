It's been six months now since the colonists settled in, and the villages 
are starting to take shape.

In **Ouskelcoule**, development is spectacular: carried by strong fishing 
activity and river exploitation thanks to the mill, the village prospers.
The original borders now seem too narrow to accommodate 
all the newcomers.

Conversely, **Douskelpar** has grown little. Its activity remains essential — 
notably thanks to its sawmill, which provides the wood necessary for building 
Ouskelcoule — but hostile climatic conditions push to maintain 
a reduced village, faithful to traditional mountain architecture.
Here, the borders originally drawn are too large and must be tightened.

The LVM administrators therefore send you on a mission to **Esdea** to 
adapt the village boundaries.
They would have gone themselves, but you know how it is: a preparation 
meeting to plan the meeting, followed by the meeting report to validate 
in meeting, not forgetting the report summary — all this takes time...
And then it's Friday and on Friday, there are fries in the cafeteria. It was therefore 
deemed preferable to delegate the mission to you since, I quote "you know the road well, the villages, the local populations." and "we trust you: you're going to do this very well!"

After much debate and stamped and double-stamped reports, they have established the following new borders:
- **Ouskelcoule** → 40 Mornifles (Mo)
- **Douskelpar** → 10 Mornifles (Mo)
