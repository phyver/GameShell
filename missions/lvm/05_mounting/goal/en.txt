Objectives
=========
The borders of Ouskelcoule, Douskelpar and Grandflac are now defined and their lands 
parceled and organized thanks to the EXT4 edict. Yet, they remain isolated.
Without an official path to access them, these villages are still only makeshift camps: 
scattered bivouacs and tents with the suspicious smell of feet from the first explorers, 
whose hygiene leaves much to be desired.

The LVM officials, wise people concerned with their daily 
ablutions, have therefore decreed that it was time to establish a first road: 
a direct link between the new villages and the rest of the kingdom.
This is the only way to bring in the workforce, supplies and tools 
necessary for building real permanent villages.

In the language of geo-mancers, this operation is called **mounting**.
It consists of officially registering a village on the kingdom's map 
(by associating it with a mount point) and tracing a carriageway through 
which colonists, stewards and goods can circulate.

Your mission is therefore to create a new province in the kingdom
for each region, then establish a road to each village:
- Open the road to **Ouskelcoule** on `./Esdea/Ouskelcoule`
- Open the road to **Douskelpar** on `./Esdea/Douskelpar`
- Open the road to **Grandflac** on `./Esdebe/Grandflac`

Then create in each village a first building "Maison Commune", and create a population.txt register with the number of village inhabitants:
- Ouskelcoule: 40 inhabitants
- Douskelpar: 20 inhabitants
- Grandflac: 50 inhabitants

Note: Don't forget the space in "Maison Commune", and write only the number in population.txt
      Also remember to make the mounted folder usable by your user with chown
