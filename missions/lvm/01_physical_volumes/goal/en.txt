Objective
=========
At the edges of the kingdom, the geo-mantic cartographers have identified two vast lands still shrouded in the mist of etheric dimensions: visible on their geo-magical maps, but not yet materialized in the tangible world.  

These phantom territories are located in a plane named by the mages as the
**Domain of Etheric Vastlands (dev)** and appear in ancient grimoires under the names **Esdea** and **Esdebe** (more prosaically referred to as **/dev/gsh_sda** and **/dev/gsh_sdb** in administrative records).  

King **Bordereau VI the Stamped** is determined to affix his seal to them before some nosy neighbor claims their annexation.  

To this end, he has established a new administration, the
**LVM (Lands & Villages Management)**, intended to bring together explorers, geo-mancers, and administrative scribes to materialize, conquer, and manage these new lands.  

But, as is fitting for any great bureaucracy, things are not going exactly as planned.  

The explorers are zealously mapping taverns, the geo-mancers are conspiring among themselves to exchange sinecures, and, worst of all, the administrative staff... administers: an activity that essentially consists of writing reports on the proceedings of the last meeting, which was intended to prepare for the next one...  

In short, all the actual work falls on your shoulders:
you, the intern on duty.  

Your first task is to give substance to these etheric lands,
transforming them into physical territories exploitable by the LVM.
The geo-mancers call this, in their obscure jargon,
the creation of **PV (Physical Volumes)**.

  WARNING!

  These missions require you to wield administrator (root) powers.
  To invoke such commands, you must always precede them with the magical seal:

      danger sudo

  Example, to list the files in a directory as admin:
      $ danger sudo ls -alh

  Be cautious before any manipulation: working in "/dev" is dangerous,
  always ensure you are working on the correct disk!
