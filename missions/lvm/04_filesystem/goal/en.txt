Objectives
===========================================
The explorers have pitched their tents in Ouskelcoule, Douskelpar and Grandflac, 
but these "villages" remain for now vast wastelands without any 
organization.

The **LVM** officials, great lovers of registers and stamps, 
have decreed that administrative rigor is necessary to avoid chaos.
According to them, before even erecting the slightest hut, it is appropriate to order the soil 
through regular division, to draw up duly stamped inventories, and to 
keep registers allowing to officially attribute each plot to 
future inhabitants.

In their technico-bureaucratic jargon, this division is called a 
**file system**.

It consists of dividing the land into **blocks** — identical surface units — 
then cataloging in registers (tables) the use of each 
block. Every house, every barn or every warehouse in the village will be assigned 
its own file, called an **inode**, on which will appear all the essential 
information: owner, dimensions, plot, allocation, etc.

Without this initial classification step, the colonists would settle randomly, 
and we would end up losing track of the granaries, markets, and even the 
village wells.

By royal decree, the chosen organization mode is 
**EXT4: "Territorial eXploitation Edict, 4th version"**, 
which sets the rules for construction, access and management of plots.

Your mission is therefore to prepare the basic infrastructure:
- Divide the **Ouskelcoule** basin into regular blocks,
- Structure the verdant slopes of **Douskelpar**,
- Develop the lush banks of **Grandflac**.
