Objectives
=========
In **Ouskelcoule**, prosperity rests on fishing: nets overflow, 
the mill runs at full capacity and markets abound with fish.
But this abundance is beginning to worry LVM administrators, 
who fear a collapse in fish prices in the kingdom if the colonies 
start exporting their catches.

For if the colonists see the river as a generous gift, the administrators 
see it mainly as a new opportunity to draft decrees, reports and counter-reports.
After several sessions (including a preparation meeting for the validation meeting 
of the preliminary report on halieutic impact), the conclusion falls:

From now on, quotas will be in effect: the colony will be forbidden 
to store more than **1,000 Kroutons (Ko)** of fish in the **Common Granary** 
of the village of **Ouskelcoule**.

Officially, it's about preserving the economy.
Unofficially, gossips claim that this decision is mainly due 
to the new policy of the **Royal Canteen Administration**, 
which has chosen to make Friday "fish day" rather than "fries day"
to support the economy of the young province of "Esdea".

Historical Note
===============
The **Krouton** (symbol Ko) is the official unit of measurement for small weights within the kingdom.
Since its implementation by **Kroûton I the Stale**, it is considered that one Krouton 
corresponds to the average weight of a bread crust that fell into the king's soup.

Learned calculations have then established that 1,000 Kroutons (Ko), placed end to end, 
possess a surface of 1 Mornifle (Mo).

Impeccable logic, according to the Royal Standards Commission, since *"a complete meal 
always consists of a good crust for the meal and a good slap for 
dessert"*.
