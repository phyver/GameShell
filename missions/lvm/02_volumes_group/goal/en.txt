Objective
=========
The ethereal territories of Esdea and Esdebe, which you have materialized into
tangible provinces (PV), are now ready to enter the administrative apparatus.

At the palace, the **LVM (Lands & Villages Management)** officials have
held an endless cycle of consultations: pre-meetings for scoping,
plenary sessions, ad hoc committees, post-session debriefs and, of course,
drafting voluminous reports distributed in triplicate.

From these works emerges a solemn decision: to preserve the balance of
ambitions and give an impression of efficiency, the new provinces will be
erected into two **independent colonies**.

In administrative language, these colonies take the name of
**Volume Groups (VG)**.

Your mission: officially establish these colonies under their official
designation (make sure to use lowercase names):
- The Colony of **Esdea**
- The Colony of **Esdebe**
