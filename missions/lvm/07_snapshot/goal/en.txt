=========
The LVM administrators, prudent people fond of paperwork, cannot stand 
the idea that a change could take place without a **certified copy** being 
archived beforehand. Lucky break, the geo-mancers have just developed a
new techno-magic allowing to store an etheric snapshot of a region.

Thus, before enlarging Ouskelcoule or reducing Douskelpar, they require you 
to produce a magical duplicate of the existing villages, in order to be able to 
"go back" in case of problems... or simply to fill an additional file 
at the Archives Office.

In geo-mancer jargon, this is called a **snapshot**.
But the explorers, much less rigorous and more inclined towards 
taverns, quickly distorted the word into **"schnapshot"**: a process that consists 
of keeping a small security reserve... like a bottom of schnapps in the bottle, 
just in case.

Some confusion between **snapshot** (copy) and **schnaps-shot** (bottoms up) are still to be deplored 
among illiterate adventurers, probably explaining why several land surveys 
are illegible — stained with wine and annotated with bawdy songs.

The LVM administrators are quite willing to manage snapshot archiving (think about it, sorting, storing, organizing papers that 
will never be read by anyone, the whole office talks about nothing else), but they're counting on you to go do the operations on site.
Make a "snapshot" of the villages of Ouskelcoule, Ouskelpar and Grandflac
- ouskelcoule_snap
- douskelpar_snap
- grandflac_snap

Note: The LVM administrators think that 5 Mornifles per snapshot are largely sufficient


Useful Commands
