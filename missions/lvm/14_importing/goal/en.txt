Objectives
=========
Aware that his kingdom's economy would be too severely impacted by 
a total break in trade relations with the former colonies, and mired 
in an inglorious war (the fact of having to individually stamp 
each arrow by a **Grand Public Verifier of Points and Shafts** probably 
not helping), King **Bordereau VI The Stamped** has consented to a meeting to sign peace.

On the other side, after long parliamentary consultations, half a dozen 
federal commissions and the creation of three new state agencies, 
the republic of **USA (Union of Autonomous Settlements)** finally admitted 
that the famous **astral teleportation** — this "disk change" proposed 
by the geo-mancers — was probably not the most advantageous solution.

For despite political independence, the USA also remains very dependent 
on trade with the neighboring kingdom: salt, tools, and especially 
Friday fries.

It was therefore decided to bury the hatchet.
And it is once again to you, poor intern turned expert in thankless tasks, 
that it falls to **unfreeze the state of the USA** and **reopen the roads between the kingdom** and the different cities of the independent republic of "USA".
