Objectives
=========
In **Douskelpar**, extreme weather conditions had already slowed 
village development. But this time, it's much worse: a violent 
rockslide has tumbled down the slopes, changing the local geography, scrambling 
the organization of plots and, much worse still, carrying away part of the registers!

Result: while the inhabitants organize among themselves to rebuild, 
with help from neighboring colonies, they seem to ignore the real urgency 
identified by LVM officials:
without registers, it is strictly impossible (except by resorting to archaic means 
such as neighborhood inquiry) to know who uses which granary, who owns which plot, 
and who gets the water from the communal well.

The LVM officials, as always, don't lack brilliant ideas:
rather than going on site to assess the damage, help the survivors and take the opportunity
to ask them who owns the houses still standing or the plots covered with rubble, 
they prefer to send you to do a **great land audit** in order to establish the **Seigneurial File for Correction of Katas (fsck)**...
this based on old maps (the fact that there is literally 
a missing piece of mountain being, after all, only a minor annoyance).

Of course, some grumblers still protest, under the pretext that *"gnagna, half of my neighbors 
are under a pile of stones"* or *"patati, but of course it's my place, I built the house 
myself with my uncle, there are even my initials carved right there"*.
But the LVM has decided: *"If it's not written in the registers, it never existed."* The question of whether the registers no longer exist having obviously nothing to do with it.

Your mission: go down to Douskelpar, inspect the registers, correct the anomalies 
and restore the cadastral order of the village.
