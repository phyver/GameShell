===========================================
The geo-mantic cartographers have spotted a new etheric land: 
**Esdece** (code name **/dev/gsh_sdc**), floating in the DEV plane very close to the province of **Esdebe**.
The LVM has therefore decided, following several symposiums, that it should be attached 
to the colony of **Esdebe** in order to promote its development.

The administrators immediately entrust the explorers with founding 
a new village there. After several commissions (and a quarrel over the 
choice of name, requiring the intervention of the clerk to physically separate 
the "Administrator of Cumbersome Registers" and the "Manager of Orthogonal 
Lists"), the decree finally falls.

The name chosen will be the one proposed by the explorers who carried out the reconnaissance mission, 
as reported by the field staff in charge of colony/LVM liaison: **Oljoliptichaaah**

The administrators have also decreed that the village's basic borders should be 10 Mornifles (Mo)

Guess who is in charge of bringing the news to the explorers in the field?

        [...]

        PAPER: So there you got on your horse and left?
        Jean Courencor: That's right, and leaving I said to him **"And for the name what do we say?"**
        PAPER: And then?
        Jean Courencor: He just yelled "Oljoliptichaaah!"
        PAPER: "Oljolipticha"?
        Jean Courencor: No, with more "a"s, "Oljoliptichaaah".
        PAPER: Hmm... Does it take an "h" at the end?
