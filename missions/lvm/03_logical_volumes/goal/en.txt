Objectives
===========================================
Now that the LVM officials have defined the organization of the provinces 
(Esdea and Esdebebe), they have drafted countless forms and pieces of paper 
granting exploitation rights to explorers in order to establish villages — 
designated by the geo-mancers under the name of **Logical Volumes (LV)** — in these new colonies.

Of course, said explorers can neither read administrative charters 
nor interpret instructions.

Aware of the problem and intrinsically convinced, like any self-respecting administrative staff, 
that not only can nothing be organized without them, but also that 
work is never better done than by others, the LVM officials 
have therefore tasked you, humble intern, to accompany the explorers in their task 
to ensure that the villages respect the guidelines established on high.

The officials have planned the foundation of the following villages:

- **Esdea**:
  - *Ouskelcoule* → the village at the bottom of the main river, with an area of 30 Mo
  - *Douskelpar* → the village perched high in the hills, with an area of 20 Mo

- **Esdebebe**:
  - *Grandflac* → the village established on the south shore of the great lake, with an area of 25 Mo

Historical Note
===============
The **Mornifle** (symbol *Mo*) is the official unit of measurement for areas 
within the Kingdom since its establishment by **Moribond I**, great-great-grandfather 
of King **Bordereau VI The Stamped**.

This unit was born from a convoluted calculation: the surface of a royal hand multiplied 
by the dimensions (in millimeters) of the chubby cheek of young prince 
**Tédéhah the Restless**.
Step by step, the official surveyors decreed that one Mornifle corresponded 
to about one of our modern hectares.
