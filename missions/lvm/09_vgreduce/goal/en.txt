Following the installation of the first colonists of **Oljoliptichaaah**, disturbing news 
has reached the kingdom.
Upon their return to **Oljoliptichaaah**, the few colonists who left to look for supplies 
at the village of **Grandflac** found a deserted place: meals still on the fire, 
and a word clumsily carved on a tree **"TOACROCAN"**, the only vestige of village life.
Some speak of strange silhouettes prowling around the camps at night.

After long discussions (and some reports filed in wrong folders, 
found by chance while moving a closet), LVM scribes finally 
noticed a detail that could have alerted from the start: the abnormal number of **"a"s** 
in the village name.

Indeed, after analysis, it would seem that the "pretty little cats" spotted 
by the first travelers are actually **affectionate 250-kilogram balls of fur**, 
equipped with **35-centimeter** fangs and whose sense of smell is not at all offended 
by the foot odors of the average adventurer.

The LVM administrators, considering it was better to prevent than to manage 
even more posthumous paperwork, have therefore decided — at least for the moment — 
to close the border and **separate Esdece from Esdebe**.
The geo-mancers have proposed to erase the village of **Oljoliptichaaah** from the maps, 
to detach the province of **Esdece** from that of **Esdebe**, and to send it back, 
temporarily, to the etheric sphere.

Of course, the administrative staff felt quite enthusiastic about the idea 
of going to discover the local fauna... but it turns out that an allergy to feline fur 
disqualifies them all de facto.
It is therefore to you, valiant and intrepid intern, that the mission falls...
