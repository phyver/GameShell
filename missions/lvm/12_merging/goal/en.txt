=========
Since their foundation, the colonies of **Esdea**, **Esdebe** and **Esdece** have patiently 
endured the decrees, quotas, audits, censuses and extraordinary commissions 
of the **LVM (Lands & Villages Management)**.

But after the **Douskelpar** collapse, the cup runneth over:
- increasingly absurd administrative controls,
- customs rules changing every week,
- unfair decisions made solely based on incomplete registers,
- and, to crown it all, the new **Salted Fish Tax** —
imposed on each Krouton (Ko) of dried cod exported from Ouskelcoule.

The triggering event was the sadly famous **Fish Party**, 
which remained in the chronicles under the name of **Krouton Party**.
One night, the inhabitants of **Ouskelcoule**, exasperated by these iniquitous taxes, 
went up to the docks, opened the granaries and threw a whole 
shipment of salted fish into the river while shouting slogans that became famous:

*"Down the stream with the fish, let's soak the Kroutons!"*
*"No taxation without ration!"*
*"The fish is ours, not the LVM's!"*

From there, a question began to circulate in all the colonies:
*"But by the way... what exactly is the LVM for?"*

Exhausted, the colonies gathered in assembly and decided it was time 
to chart their own path.
They proclaimed their **independence** and founded a new kingdom: the **Union of Autonomous Settlements (USA)**, **Settlements** being the name given by the colonists to their first camps.

The LVM did try to protest, and explain to the colonists that they first had to fill out form "B-12" to obtain receipt "A-127" necessary to file their case with the "Complaints and Claims Office", open every fourth Thursday of the month from 2:30 PM to 2:55 PM, but the colonists seemed little sensitive to the argument, too busy symbolically throwing stamps, feathers and registers marked with the LVM emblem into the river.

Eager to organize their kingdom according to a new form of government, they have entrusted you, chief intern Trauma Jefassonne, a literate individual who has always been by their side in the field, to organize and implement the separation of the colonies from the kingdom and their fusion into a new entity. Sharing their annoyance against the administrative absurdity of the kingdom in general, and the LVM in particular, you have decided to accept and join the cause
of the rebels!

Your first job as organizer of independence will therefore be:
- To cut the roads between the kingdom and the colony villages
- To rename the colony of Esdea to "USA"
- To attach the colony of Esdebe to that of Esdea.

Note: Be careful, you may have to delete old snapshots that might be lying around in the bottom of LVM drawers
