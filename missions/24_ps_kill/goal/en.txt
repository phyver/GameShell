Mission goal
============

The rats are not happy: to scare them away, an infernal machine that 
generates wind-up cats has been installed in the pantry (in the 
kitchen).

Find and kill the cat generator, and remove all the cats that hide 
in the pantry.

NOTE: the generator is a process, while the cats themselves are 
files.


Useful commands
===============

ps
  list the process that are currently executed by the shell

kill N
  kill the process with number ("PID") N
