Mission goal
============

The rats are not happy: to scare them away, an infernal machine 
that generates wind-up cats has been installed in the pantry (in 
the castle's cellar).

Find and kill the cat generator, and remove all the cats that 
are hiding in the pantry.

NOTE: the generator is a process, while the cats themselves are 
files.


Useful commands
===============

ps
  List the processes that are currently executed by the shell.

kill N
  Kill the process with number N.
  Remark: N is called PID, or "process identifier".

Recall that wildcards "*" and "?" do not see hidden files. You need 
to add an explicit dot at the start of the pattern to capture hidden 
files.
