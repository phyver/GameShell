Mission goal
============

Collect all the coins that you can find in the cellar of the 
castle, and put them in your chest in your cabin in the forest.


Useful commands
===============

mv FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEn DIRNAME
  Move all the files to the directory DIRNAME.
  Remark: ``mv`` is an abbreviation of "move".

~
  Abbreviation for the initial directory. In our game, this
  directory is called "World" and can be seen in the path
  given by ``pwd``. (The initial directory may depend on the
  shell that is used.)
  Example: if you are in the "Forest", ``ls ~/Castle`` lists
  the locations accessible from the "Castle".
