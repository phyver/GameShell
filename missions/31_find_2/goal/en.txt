Mission goal
============

Look for the ruby in the maze (in the garden), and move it to your 
chest.

Hint: the filename does not contain the chaine "ruby". One possible 
strategy is to look for a **file** (instead of a directory), and 
check by hand that the file contains the string "ruby".


Useful commands
===============

find
  search files from the current working directory

  Conditions on the file may be added about filenames, size, 
  modification date, etc.

  An interesting condition is
    -type TYPE

cat FILE
  output the content of the file on the screen

man CMD
  to read the manual for command CMD

  Here are the main keybindings in manual pages:
    q           quit
    Space       scroll down one page
    / STRING    search for string
    n           go to next occurrence of previous search string
