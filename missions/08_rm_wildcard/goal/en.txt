Useful commands
===============

*
?
  The "*" character stands in for any sequence of characters
  (including an empty sequence).

  The "?" character stands in for any single character.

  They can be used to denote lists of existing files / directories

  Example: if the current folder contains
      file-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
  then
    *     -->  file-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
    *1    -->  file-1 Folder-1
    *o*   -->  Folder-1 potato
    x*    -->  error, no matching file
    *-?   -->  file-1 Folder-1
    *-??  -->  file-14

  NOTE: "*" and "?" don't see hidden files, you need to add an 
  explicit dot at the start of the pattern.
