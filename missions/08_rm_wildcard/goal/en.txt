Mission goal
============

Get rid of all the spiders that are hiding in the cellar. 
Again, do not do not disturb the salamanders.


Shell patterns
==============

*
  The "*" character stands in for any sequence of characters
  (including an empty sequence).

?
  The "?" character stands in for any single character.

Those wildcards can be used to denote lists of existing files / 
directories

For example: if the current folder contains
      file-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
then
    *     -->  file-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
    *1    -->  file-1 Folder-1
    *o*   -->  Folder-1 potato
    x*    -->  error, no matching file
    *-?   -->  file-1 Folder-1
    *-??  -->  file-14


Remark
------

The wildcards "*" and "?" don't see hidden files, you need to add an 
explicit dot at the start of the pattern.
