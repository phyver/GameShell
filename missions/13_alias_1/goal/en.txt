Mission goal
============

It is taking too long to check for hidden spiders! Create an 
alias "la" to run the command ``ls -A`` in order to list all
files, including hidden ones, more easily.

Define the alias

  la='ls -A'

and check that it works as expected.


Useful commands
===============

alias NAME='CMD'
  Create a command with a short name NAME to stand for the 
  longer command CMD.
