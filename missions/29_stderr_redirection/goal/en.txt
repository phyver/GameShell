Mission goal
============

Merlin's old spellbooks are kept in his office, 
in the library. You need to output a list of all 
the spellbooks containing the incantation "pq" (or 
"Pq", or "pQ", or "PQ").

Some of those spellbooks are locked, and you are not 
allowed to consult them. You need to ignore them.

**NOTE:** only the list of spellbooks is required.
The incantation should not be printed on the screen.


Useful commands
===============

Every command can output messages to the screen in 
two ways:
  - standard printing ("STDOUT")
  - error printing ("STDERR")
By default, both kind of messages are show on the screen.

It is however possible to redirect both of them 
to files independently..

  grep STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
    search for a string inside a file and print the 
    corresponding lines
    Some interesting options are
      -l : do not print the lines, but only the filenames 
           containing the string
      -i : do not differentiate between uppercase and 
           lowercase

  CMD  >  FILE
    standard messages (STDOUT) are sent to the 
    file instead of being printed on the screen
    (The file is overwritten.)

  CMD  2>  FICHIER
    error messages (STDERR) are sent to the file 
    instead of being printed on the screen
    (The file is overwritten.)

  /dev/null
    "virtual" file that acts as a blackhole: anything 
    sent to it is ignored
