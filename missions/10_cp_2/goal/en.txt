Mission goal
============

By the way, I think that the ornaments in the castle's entrance 
would very much suit my cabin. Likewise, I cannot just remove them 
for here. I would like to have a copy of these ornaments in my 
cabin.

Useful commands
===============

*
?
  The "*" character is a wildcard for any string of character.

  The "? character is a wildcard for any single character.

  They can be used to denote lists of existing files.

  For instance, if the folder contains
      File-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
  then
    *     -->  File-1 Folder-1 file-14 potato
    *1    -->  File-1 Folder-1
    *o*   -->  Folder-1 potato
    x*    -->  error, no matching file
    *-?   -->  File-1 Folder-1
    *-??  -->  file-14
