Mission goal
============

Create a file named "journal.txt" in your chest and write a 
short message in it.
You can use this file to record your notes and solutions for 
the upcoming missions.

NOTE: ``nano`` is a command-line text editor. You can use it 
whenever you need to edit a file from the shell.


Useful commands
===============

nano FILE
  Edit the FILE from the shell.
  (If the file does not exist, it will be created.)
  Keybindings are listed at the bottom of the screen (the "^" 
  symbol means "Control"). The most important ones are:
    Control-x     quit
    Control-o     save
    Control-w     search for a string

  NOTE: do not use Control-s or Control-z!
