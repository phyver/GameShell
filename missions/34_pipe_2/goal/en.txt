Mission goal
============

Combine several commands with ``|`` in order to find the number of 
unpaid items.

NOTE: you are only allowed a single command besides ``gash check``.
You can always reset the counter with `gash reset`, but the whole 
stall will be re-generated.


Useful commands
===============

grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  filter the files lines, keeping only those that contain the given 
  string
  If no file is given, the command uses stdin.

  interesting option:
    -v : invert the condition to only keep the lines that do not 
    contain the string

wc [FILE]
  count the number of lines / words / characters in a file
  If no file is given, the command uses stdin.
