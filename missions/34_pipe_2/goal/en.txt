Mission goal
============

Combine several commands with "|" in order to find the number 
of unpaid items.

**NOTE:** you are only allowed a single command besides 
`gash check`.
You can always reset the counter with `gash reset`, but the 
whole stall will be re-generated.


Useful commands
===============

  grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
    filter the files lines, keeping only those that contain 
    the given string
    If no file is given, the command uses stdin.

    interesting option:
      -v : invert the condition to only keep the lines that 
      do not contain the string

  wc [FILE]
    count the number of lines / words / characters in a 
    file
    If no file is given, the command uses stdin.
