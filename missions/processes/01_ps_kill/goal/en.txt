Mission goal
============

A mischievous mountain imp cast a spell that puts paint (or is it 
something worse?) stains everywhere in the castle.
You need to find this spell and remove it.

Remark
------

The spell is a process.


Useful commands
===============

ps
  List the processes that are currently executed by the shell.

kill N
  Send the termination signal to process number N.
  Remark: N is called PID, or "process identifier".

clear
  Clear the screen.
  The keybinding "Control-l" does the same and is often quicker to 
  use.
