Mission goal
============

The mischievous imp has more than one trick up his sleeve. He 
managed to protect his spell against most tampering.
You need to find this spell and try to remove it with standard 
signal. If it doesn't work, use a more brutal signal.


Remark
------

The spell is a process.


Useful commands
===============

ps
  List the processes that are currently executed by the shell.

kill [OPTIONS] N
  Send the termination signal to process number N.

  Useful options:
    -s SIGNAL   choose the signal to send by giving its name
    -NUMBER     choose the signal to send by giving its number
    -l          give the list of available signals with their number

clear
  Clear the screen.
  The keybinding "Control-L" does the same and is often quicker to 
  use in the terminal.

Details
-------

By default ``kill`` sends the "TERM" signal to the processes (TERM 
stands for "termination").
Processes may ignore some signals, but the "KILL" signal cannot be 
ignored!
