Mission goal
============

The hermit now asks you to read him the instructions from lines 
9 to 11 of the **recipe** for his potion.

To do that, you will need to combine the previous two commands
using a ``|``.


Useful commands
===============

head -n K FILE
  output the first K lines from the file

  If FILE is omitted, the command acts on its standard input 
  (STDIN), ie what it "receives".

tail -n K FILE
  output the last K lines from the file

  If FILE is omitted, the command acts on its standard input 
  (STDIN), ie what it "receives".

CMD1 | CMD2
 make CMD2 acts on what it receives from CMD1
