Mission goal
============

A secret message has been found in the library.
It was probably enciphered using a Caesar shift cipher.

Decrypt it by making an exhaustive search from the command line.


Useful commands
===============

tr STRING1 STRING2 < FILE
  replace ("tr"anslate) each character STRING1[i] by STRING2[i] in 
  the file, and output the result. (The file is not modified.)

  Example: if
      CHAINE1 = "abcdef"
      CHAINE2 = "klmnop"
  the file will be output with the following substitution (other 
  characters are left unchanged)
      a -> k      b -> l      c -> m
      d -> n      e -> o      f -> p

  Note: instead of "abcdefg", it is possible to write "a-g".
