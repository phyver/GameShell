Mission goal
============

Combine several commands with ``|`` in order to find the number of 
unpaid items.

Remark
------

You are only allowed a single command.

You can always reset the counter with `gsh reset`, but the whole 
stall will be re-generated.


Useful commands
===============

grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  Filter the files lines, keeping only those that contain the given 
  string.
  If no file is given, the command uses stdin.

  Useful option
    -v : only show the lines that **do not contain** the string.

wc FILE
  Count the number of lines / words / characters in a file
  If no file is given, ``wc`` counts lines / words / characters on 
  stdin.
