Mission goal
============

Next to the castle, there is a merchant stall. People often buy on 
credit and reimburse their debt when they can.
The shopkeeper keeps books on everyone's debt on a scroll. Whenever 
someone pays his debt, he inscribes "PAID" next to the corresponding 
transaction.

Combine several commands with ``|`` in order to find the King's 
debt.

Remark
------

You are only allowed 3 commands to find the King's debt.
You can always reset the counter with `gsh reset`, but the whole 
stall and the debts of everyone will be re-generated as well.


Hint
----

When there are no sub-directories, an alternative to ``find . -name 
'*boring_object*'`` is to use `ls` and filter the result with grep:
  $ ls | grep "boring_object"


Useful commands
===============

grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  Filter the files lines, keeping only those that contain the given 
  string.
  If no file is given, ``grep`` uses stdin.

  Useful option
    -v : only show the lines that **do not contain** the string.
