Mission goal
============

A forgetful old hermit called Servillus has set up camp in a 
cave with his old, leather-bound potion book. Go to the cave 
and help him remember the recipe of his famous herbal tea.

In order to validate the mission, your last command prior to 
``gsh check`` must show the recipe (including its title) but 
nothing else (there should be no blank line at the end).
