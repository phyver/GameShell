Mission goal
============

While skimming the book you notice that the page that should 
contain the recipe of the bottled death potion has been torn 
off. Each line of the page (excluding the first three lines) 
must have contained a step of the recipe. But how many steps 
were there? Find out!

In order to validate the mission, your last command prior to 
``gsh check`` must give the number of steps in the recipe.


Useful commands
===============

wc -l
  Count the number of lines sent on the standard input.

tail -n +K FILE
  Print the last lines of the file starting with line K.

COMMAND1 | COMMAND2
  Run the two commands, feeding the "standard output" of the 
  former as the "standard input" of the latter.
  Remark: by analogy with plumbing "|" is called "pipe".
