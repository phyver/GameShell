Mission goal
============

The old hermit notices your interest for potion recipes, and 
sees promise in your ability to lookup lists of ingredients. 
He challenges you to find the steps for the elixir of Youth.

In order to validate the mission, your last command prior to 
``gash check`` must show the steps for the recipe and nothing 
else (no title, no blank lines).


Useful commands
===============

cat FILE1 FILE2 ... FILEn
  Display the contents of the files in order.

tail
  Print the last 10 lines sent on the standard input.

tail -n K
  Print the last K lines sent on the standard input.

COMMAND1 | COMMAND2
  Run the two commands, feeding the "standard output" of the 
  former as the "standard input" of the latter.
  Remark: by analogy with plumbing "|" is called "pipe".


Explanations
============

Many of the commands we have seen so far are used to process 
text: they receive text as input and produce text as output. 
It is common for commands to take their input in one or more 
files, and to write their output to their "standard output", 
which means that (by default) the output is written into the
terminal. Dually to the "standard output" commands also have 
a "standard input" on which they can receive input.

Most commands are able to receive input either through files 
(given as arguments) or their standard input. For example:
- ``head FILE`` reads its input from the file,
- ``head`` reads its input on the standard input,
- ``cat FILE1 FILE2`` reads its input from the files,
- ``cat`` reads its input on the standard input.
