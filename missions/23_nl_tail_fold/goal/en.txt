Mission goal
============

The hermit now wants to see the end of the recipe for his potion. 
Unfortunately, the steps are not numbered. List the last steps of 
the recipe using a single command, in such a way that:
  - only the last 7 steps of the recipe are shown,
  - each step is numbered as it would be in the complete recipe,
  - no line of the recipe should be more than 50 characters long.

To do that, you will need to combine several commands (including 
the previously seen ``tail``) using a ``|``.

NOTE: to help you, the hermit has written the start of the recipe 
with the same constraints.


Useful commands

  Print each line of the FILE with its line number.

  If FILE is omitted, the command acts on its standard input.

  If FILE is omitted, the command acts on its standard input.
