Mission goal
============

The hermit now wants to see the end of the recipe for his potion. 
Unfortunately, the steps are not numbered.
You need to list the last steps of the recipe with a single command, 
while respecting the constraints given by the old man:
  - only the last 7 steps of the recipe are shown,
  - each step is numbered as it would be in the complete recipe,
  - no line of the recipe should be more than 50 characters wide.

To do that, you will need to combine the previous two commands
using a ``|``.

NOTE: to help you, the hermit has written the start of the recipe 
with the same constraints.
