Mission goal
============

Combine several commands with "|" in order to find the diamond in 
the maze, and move it to your chest.


NOTE: the filename doesn't contain the string "diamond".
You need to find a file that contains the string "diamond".


Useful commands
===============

find
  search files from the current working directory

  Conditions on the file may be added about filenames, size, 
  modification date, etc.

grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  filter the files lines, keeping only those that contain the given 
  string

  An interesting option is
    -l  only print the names of files containing the string

xargs CMD
  read lines from stdin and run the command
    CMD LINE1 LINE2 ... LINEn
  This command is particularly useful after a "|" redirection.
