Mission goal
============

Combine several commands with "|" in order to find the 
diamond in the labyrinth, and move it to your trunk.


NOTE: the filename doesn't contain the string "diamond".
You need to find a file that contains the string "diamond".


Useful commands
===============

  find
    search files from the current working directory

    conditions on the file may be added about filenames, 
    size, modification date, etc.

  grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
    filter the files lines, keeping only those that contain 
    the given string

    An interesting option is
      -l  only print the names of files containing the string

  xargs CMD
    read lines from stdin and run the command
      CMD LINE1 LINE2 ... LINEn
    This command is particularly usefull after a "|" 
    redirection.
