Mission goal
============

The hermit now wants to see the end of the recipe for his potion. 
Unfortunately, the steps are not numbered. List the last steps of 
the recipe using a single command, in such a way that:
  - only the last 7 steps of the recipe are shown,
  - each step is numbered as it would be in the complete recipe,
  - no line of the recipe should be more than 50 characters long.

To do that, you will need to combine several commands using ``|``.

Remark
------

To help you, the hermit has written the start of the recipe with the 
same constraints.
