Mission goal
============

Look for the ruby in the maze in the garden, and move it to your 
chest.

Hint
----

The filename does not contain the string "ruby". Since there aren't 
many files in the maze, a possible strategy is to look for all 
**file** (as opposed to directories), and check by hand which one 
contains the string "ruby".


Useful commands
===============

find
  Search files / directories from the current working directory.

  Conditions may be added about names, size, modification date, etc.
  An interesting condition is:
    -type TYPE

cat FILE
  Output the content of the file on the screen.

man COMMAND
  Display the manual of the command.

  Important key bindings:
    q           quit
    Space       scroll down one page
    / STRING    search for the string
    n           find the next occurrence of the
                search string

Remark
------

The description of the ``find`` command is deliberately kept short. 
You will find more information in the manual. (You can for example 
search for the string "-type" in the manual.)
