Mission goal
============

Look for the ruby in the maze (in the garden), and move it to your 
chest.

Hint
----

The filename does not contain the chaine "ruby". Since there aren't 
many files in the maze, a possible strategy is to look for all 
**file**, and check by hand which one contains the string "ruby".


Useful commands
===============

find
  Search files from the current working directory.

  Conditions on the file may be added about filenames, size, 
  modification date, etc.

  An interesting condition is
    -type TYPE

cat FILE
  Output the content of the file on the screen.

man COMMAND
  Display the manual of the command.

  Important key bindings:
    q           quit
    Space       scroll down one page
    / STRING    search for the string
    n           find the next occurrence for the search string

Remark
------

The description of the ``find`` command is deliberately kept short. 
You will find more information in the manual. (You can for exemple 
search for the string "-type" in the manual.)
