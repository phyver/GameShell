Mission goal
============

Combine several commands with "|" in order to find the diamond in 
the maze, and move it to your chest.


Remark
------

The filename doesn't contain the string "diamond". You need to find 
a file that contains the string "diamond".


Useful commands
===============

find
  Search files from the current working directory.
  Conditions on the file may be added about filenames, size, 
  modification date, etc.

grep [OPTIONS] STRING FILE1 ... FILEn
  Search for a string inside the files.

  Useful option:
    -l  only print the names of files containing the string.

xargs COMMAND
  read lines from stdin and run the command
    COMMAND LINE1 LINE2 ... LINEn
  ``xargs`` is particularly useful after a ``|`` redirection.
