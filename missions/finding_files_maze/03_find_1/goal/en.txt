Useful commands
===============

find CONDITION
  Search for files satisfying the condition, starting from your 
  current working directory.

  There are many possible conditions. They can constrain the
  file names, size, modification date, etc. For example 
    -name "PATTERN"
    -iname "PATTERN"
  are both related to file names.

man COMMAND
  Display the manual of the command.

  Important key bindings:
    q           quit
    Space       scroll down one page
    / STRING    search for the string
    n           find the next occurrence of the
                search string

Remark
------

The description of the ``find`` command is deliberately kept short. 
You will find more information in the manual. (You can for example 
search for the string "-name" in the manual.)
