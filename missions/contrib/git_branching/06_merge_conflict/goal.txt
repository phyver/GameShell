Mission goal
============

Last but not least, merge the contribution you made on branch power. You might end-up in a conflict. 

Ensure you keep your version with the goat hair.


Useful commands
===============

To merge a branch. Ensure you are on the branch you want to merge into and then
git merge BRANCH_NAME

If you end up into a CONFLICT and would like to abort the current merge operation
git merge --abort

## What is a conflict ?
A conflict occurs when git is asked to merge two commits where the same line of the same file is modified in both commits.
In our case, the spell on the power branch has its first line modified and spell on the main branch has also its first line modified.

When a conflict occurs, git modifies the file in the working directoy like this:
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    33
    =======
    66
    >>>>>>> power

Between the <<< and the === the version of the branch pointed by HEAD, so in our case the main branch
Between the === and the >>> the version of power branch
Git cannot decide which one is the right one, you have to decide if the first version has be kept, the second, a mix of both, yet a third version... 

## How to fix a conflict ?

-   Replace everything between the <<< and the >>> by the correct version
-   git add file
-   git commit
-   Automatic commit message indicating conflict resolution
