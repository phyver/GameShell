Mission goal
============

You now have a good idea of the synchronisation process.


It might be usefull to regroup spells in chapters in your book.

Create a first chapter (a directory) `Chapter_1`. Then create a spell "truth.sh" in this chapter which reminds you of an old thuth: "There is no spoon"

TODO:
- not sure it is a good idea to ask the students to write a shell script... To be discussed

Apply the full synchronisation process to your new chapter and its content.


Useful commands
===============
you need to create file named "truth.sh"


nano file.txt : opens a file with an editor


source spell2.sh   : run the script spell2.sh 

echo "Some Message" : print "Some Message" in the shell

mkdir Chapter_1

git add Folder : 

start tracking "Folder" and its content. It can be used to stagged all the modifications in that folder

git commit -m " ...." : commit the stagged modifications 

git push
