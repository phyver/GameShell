So as you can see with `git status`, the new spell is not being tracked by the portal system yet.


Add the file to the staging area and check what is the output of `git status` now


Useful commands
===============

To add a file or modifications of a file to the staging area
git add FILE_NAME


To show the state of your local repository, staging area and working directory
git status 



NB
===============

Do not commit or push the file.
