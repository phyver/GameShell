Mission creation guide
======================


Convention
----------

In the rest of this document, `$GSH_ROOT` will represent GameShell's root
directory.


GameShell directory structure
-----------------------------

GameShell files are organized in several directories. The important ones when
creating missions are the following:

* `$GSH_HOME` contains the root of GameShell's "world": the file hierarchy
  where the player is expected to move around. It is initially empty, and the
  missions populate it.
  Even though this is also the `HOME` directory of the player, using
  `$GSH_HOME` is preferred over `$HOME` or `~`.

* `$GSH_TMP` contains all the "hidden" data that may be created by a mission:
  temporary files, data required to check completion, data shared between
  missions, etc. Except in specific case ("dummy missions"), it is a good
  policy that each mission removes the files it creates.


Mission structure
-----------------

A mission is simply a directory with a set of files. This directory must be
somewhere under [`$GSH_ROOT/missions/`](../missions), typically inside
[`$GSH_ROOT/missions/contrib/`](../missions/contrib).

A mission has the following structure, most of the files being optional:

```
$GSH_ROOT/missions/.../MISSION_NAME
├── auto.sh
├── gshrc
├── bin
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── check.sh                    REQUIRED
├── clean.sh                    OFTEN NEEDED
├── goal.txt / goal.sh          REQUIRED
├── i18n
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── init.sh                     ALMOST REQUIRED
├── sbin
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── static.sh                   ALMOST REQUIRED
├── test.sh
├── treasure.sh
└── treasure-msg.txt / treasure-msg.sh
```

Only 2 files are really required:
* `check.sh` to check for completion of the mission,
* `goal.txt` (or variant) to display the goal of the mission.

However, most missions will also need 2 other files:
* `static.sh` to initialize the static parts of the mission,
* `init.sh` to initialize the dynamic parts of the mission

The `static.sh` script is run during GameShell's initialisation (before the
first mission is even started). This allows to populate the world with the
different places (i.e., directories) where the missions will take place.

Th `init.sh` script is run whenever the mission is (re-)started. It allows to
have missions with some randomized element to prevent brute force searching or
sharing of easy solutions among students.


We will now describe in details what's expected in those 4 files. (The other
files will be described in the next section.)


### Note on missions' `sh` files

All the missions' `sh` files are **sourced**. This was decided in the early
versions of GameShell to make it possible to
  - check the player defined an alias,
  - change the current working directory of the player,
  - define some environment variables.

Most of the time, the `sh` scripts could be run in a subshell, which has the
advantage of making sure the environment is not polluted by leftovers from the
script.

A good policy to adopt is that *except when you specifically need it*, the
script should execute in a subshell. The easiest way to do that is to define a
function
```sh
_mission_init() (
  ...
)
```
Using parenthesis rather than braces ensures the function is run inside a
subshell.
Note that after sourcing a file `init.sh`, the function `_mission_init` is
automatically removed. The same is true for `check.sh` (where the function
`_mission_check` is unset) or any of the other `sh` files.


If not using a function, `unset`ing all the defined variables is encouraged.

Note also that even if bash, zsh, or even dash have them, POSIX shell
functions don't have a concept of `local` variables. In other words,
```sh
_mission_init() {
  dir=$GSH_ROOT/Castle
  mkdir -p "$dir"
}
```
defines a *global* variable `dir`!

When running in verbose debug mode (flag `-D`), GameShell will print all
changes in the environment it detects.


In some cases, those files may be sourced from a subshell. This happens for
example if the previous mission was checked in a subshell, with something like
```sh
$ SOME_COMMAND | gsh check
```
In such a case, `gsh check` happens in a subshell, and sourcing of the next
`init.sh` file happens in this same subshell.

To prevent bugs when a mission specifically requires initialisation to change
the environment, GameShell tries to detect when a script is sourced in a
subshell. If it detects the environment has changed *and* that this happened
in a subshell, a warning is displayed asking the player to run `gsh reset`.



### `static.sh`

Like all `.sh` files defining the mission, `static.sh` is *sourced* by
GameShell.
It is first sourced when initializing a new game, and its typical use is
creating the "world map". A mission taking place in the castle's cellar would
use
```sh
mkdir -p "$GSH_HOME/Castle/Cellar"
```
and would thus make sure the cellar exists when the game is started, even
though the first mission might take place somewhere else.

Because all missions need not be included in a customized GameShell archive,
it is important to create all the required places in `static.sh` and not
depend on them being created by another mission.

Because of that, sourcing `static.sh` shouldn't provoke an error if a place /
object already exists: you should for example use `mkdir -p` to create
directories.

To avoid potential problems if a player removed part of the world, this file is
also sourced whenever the corresponding missions is (re-)started.

This file should always use absolute path by using `$GSH_HOME`. It can also
use the directory `$MISSION_DIR` that points to the mission's directory. This
is useful if the mission needs to copy files into GameShell's world.


_Note_ that because this file is sourced, it can change the working directory
or define environment variables. This is discouraged for the following
reasons.

* Those files are not re-sourced when restarting a previous game. In that
  case, only the `static.sh` file corresponding to the current mission will be
  sourced.
* It is possible, when starting a new mission, that this file is sourced from
  a subshell. In that case, changing directory or defining environment
  variables will not have any effect.

If you need to define environment variables that will be available throughout
the game, use a `gshrc` file in the mission.


### `goal.txt` / `goal.sh`

The file `goal.txt` should be a UTF-8 encoded text file containing the
description of the mission. It is displayed when the player runs the command
`gsh goal`.

They usually follow the following pattern:
```
Mission goal
============

Find a frog in the swamp.


Useful commands
===============

cd PLACE
  Move to the given place, if accessible from you current location.
```

For uniformity, meta-variables in commands should be in UPPERCASE.

If you require a "dynamic" goal, for example because it contains some
randomized data, you can replace `goal.txt` by `goal.sh`, which will be
sourced each time the player runs `gsh goal`.
(Note that randomized parts of the missions should probably be generated by
`init.sh`, not by `goal.sh`.)


### `init.sh`

This file is sourced whenever the mission is started. It is typically used to
(re-)generate the dynamic parts of the mission.
_It is not sourced during the initialisation of GameShell._

The corresponding `static.sh` file is sourced just before it, so `init.sh` can
depend on the static part existing.

Remember that this script is sourced every time the mission is (re-)started. If
it creates files with randomized names, make sure you don't end up with
several versions of them by removing them first. (Or better yet, write a
`clean.sh` script.)


**If the last return value is `false` (anything different from `0`), the mission
is cancelled.**

This is typically used to check that the dependencies for the mission are met
(e.g., that every necessary command is available on the system). When some
dependency is not met then a helpful error message is polite.


### `check.sh`

The `check.sh` is the only required file in a mission. It is sourced when the
player runs `gsh check` to validate (or not) the current mission.

Since it is sourced (for uniformity with the other scripts), it requires some
care. It must end with a command returning 0 (typically `true`) in case of
success, and by a command returning something else (typically `false`) in case
of failure. In case of failure an explanation message is expected.

Whenever checking is even slightly complex, the script `check.sh` usually
looks like
```sh
_mission_check() {
  ...
  ...
}

_mission_check
```

_Note_ that because this file is sourced, it can change directory or define
environment variables. This is discouraged because sourcing might happen from
a subshell (in case of `COMMAND | gsh check` for example). In that case,
changing directory or defining environment variables will not have any effect.

If you need to define environment variables that will be available for the
remaining missions, use a `treasure.sh` file.



### `clean.sh` (optional)

This file is sourced:

* after the mission is checked (successfully or not),
* when the mission is "skipped" with `gsh skip`,
* when the mission is left with `gsh goto N`,
* when the player exits GameShell.

It should remove the parts of the missions that won't be necessary anymore,
either because they will be regenerated if the mission is restarted (by
`init.sh`), or because the mission was successfully validated.

Before sourcing this file, a variable `GSH_LAST_ACTION` is set to the command
that sourced it:
* `exit`
* `skip`
* `check_true`
* `check_false`
* `goto`
* `reset`
* `hardreset`
* `assert`


The other files
---------------

The other files are not used as often but allow to customize GameShell.


### `gshrc` (optional)

This file is added to the global configuration of the shell session used
during the game. It can be used to define variables, aliases, functions, etc..
They will be available throughout the game.


### `treasure.sh` (optional)

This file is sourced after the mission has been successfully validated (with
`gsh check`). It can be used to add new features as rewards to certain
missions.

Note that this file is also added to the global configuration so that the
reward is still available when you restart the game. As a consequence there
should be no output. (See the `treasure-msg.txt` file.)


### `treasure-msg.txt` / `treasure-msg.sh` (optional)

The file `treasure-msg.txt` is expected to be a UTF-8 encoded text file. It is
displayed when the mission is successfully completed. If the terminal is wide
enough, a fancy treasure chest is added to the left of the message.

This can be used to inform the player that a treasure (i.e., a feature installed
by `treasure.sh`) has been won.

Instead of `treasure-msg.txt`, a script `treasure-msg.sh` can be used to
generate a dynamic message. If it exists, `treasure-msg.sh` is sourced when
the mission is successfully completed. Note that if this file finished with a
non 0 return value, the `treasure.sh` file is *neither sourced nor installed*.
It can be used to avoid problems when some `treasure.sh` has some
dependencies.


### `bin/` (optional)

The files contained in this directory will be "copied" to the directory
`$GSH_BIN`. The directory is in the global `PATH`, so those files are
directly available to the player.


### `sbin/` (optional)

The files contained in this directory will be "copied" to the directory
`$GSH_SBIN`. (The directory is not in the global `PATH`, so those
files are _not_ directly available to the player.) This is particularly useful
for "dummy" missions.


### `i18n/` (optional)

This directory contains the files related to [internationalization](i18n.md).


### `auto.sh` (optional)

This file is sourced when the command `gsh auto` is run. It should
automatically validate the corresponding mission. In other words, the commands
in this file should perform whatever steps are the necessary to complete the
mission, followed by the `gsh check` command.

That's mainly useful for testing, and those files aren't included in GameShell
archives by default.


### `test.sh` (optional)

This file is sourced by the command `gsh test`, which is only available in
debug mode. The `test.sh` script usually uses a mix of standard shell commands
and the special commands `gsh assert check true` (or `gsh assert check false`)
which make testing easier.

Those files are not included in GameShell archives.


Adding the mission to the `index.txt` file
----------------------------------------

When run without arguments GameShell will get the list of mission from the
file `$GSH_ROOT/missions/index.txt`.

You can give a list of `index.txt` files and mission directories as arguments
of GameShell if you want to customize the list / order of missions. This is
particularly useful when testing a new mission:
```sh
$ ./start.sh -Rdq missions/contrib/my_new_mission
```
(The `-R` flag resets the previous game, the flag `-d` will run GameShell in
"debug" mode, and the `-q` flag removes the small messages at the start of
each mission.)


Dummy missions
--------------

"Dummy" missions are used to share data between missions. A mission is "dummy"
* either when it doesn't contain a `check.sh` script,
* or it is listed with a "`!`" in front of its name in the `index.txt` file.

A dummy mission is used during the initialisation phase, so that it can
contain a `static.sh` file. It can for example be used to share executable
files in its `bin` or `sbin` directory.

It can also contain data that will be used by other missions:
* either the `static.sh` file can copy the data to `$GSH_TMP` (or some other
  place),
* or the real missions can use symbolic links (with relative path) to refer to
  that data.

A real mission in `$GSH_MISSIONS/contrib/jungle/01_hide_elephant` could for
example use
```sh
cp "$MISSION_DIR/../00_shared/ascii-art/elephant.txt" "$GSH_HOME/Jungle/"
```

_Note:_ don't forget to include dummy missions in the corresponding
`index.txt` file, or it won't be included in GameShell executable archives by
default.


If several missions share an `init.sh` script (or `clean.sh`, or whatever), it
can be included in a dummy mission, while the actual missions use a symbolic
link to it.

_Note:_ when sourcing a symbolic link,
* the variable `$MISSION_DIR` refers to the _physical_ directory containing
  the file (the symbolic link is expanded),
* the variable `$MISSION_NAME` refers to the _logical_ name of the mission
  containing the file (the symbolic link is _not_ expanded).
* the variable `$MISSION_NB` refers to the index of the _logical_ mission.
