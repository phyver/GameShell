GameShell user manual
=====================


Starting GameShell
------------------

You can either start GameShell from an executable archive (typically
`GameShell.sh`) with

    $ ./GameShell.sh

or from the `start.sh` script in the source-code directory

    $ ./GameShell/start.sh

If for some reason those files don't the execute bit set, you can run them
with `bash` or set the execute bit with `chmod +x ...`

The default options shouldn't need changing, but if they do, use the `-h` flag
to get a list of available options.


Playing GameShell, standard commands
------------------------------------

Playing GameShell involves very few commands specific to GameShell. They are

* `gsh goal`: displays the current mission's goal. If the goal doesn't fit on
  the screen, it is paginated with `more` command.
  If `python3` is installed, an ASCII-art box is added around the goal.

* `gsh check`: checks if the current mission is completed. If so, a
  congratulation message is displayed, and the player starts the next mission.
  If not, the mission is reset.
  A player can run `gsh check` as many times as she wants.

* `gsh reset`: if the player messed up the mission by removing an important
  file, this command will try to reset the mission, without checking for
  completion first.

* `gsh help`: displays a small message with this very information.


The command `gsh exit` will quit the current game, but it is customary to use
the sequence `Control-d` for the same purpose.



Playing GameShell, other commands
---------------------------------

In some situations, some other commands are useful. They are described by the
`gsh HELP` command. Here are the main ones.

* `gsh pass`: it has unfortunately happened that some bug prevented a mission
  to be completed successfully. The command `gsh pass` will cancel the
  current mission and go to the next one. Running this command will first ask
  for a password (except in debug mode) to avoid students overusing it. (Just
  like most other `gsh` commands, the use of this command is logged.)

* `gsh goto N`: when the previous command isn't sufficient, `gsh goto N`
  which will go directly to mission `N`. Just like `gsh pass`, this command
  will first ask for a password.

* `gsh protect` and `gsh unprotect`: the directories containing GameShell
  code and data are neither readable nor writable by the player. (Except in
  debug mode, or when running from the source repository.) That's to prevent
  accident where a player inadvertently removes some important file.
  Those commands reset the read / write permissions. (No password is necessary
  for them.)

* `gsh auto`: if the mission comes with an automatic script (`auto.sh`), this
  command will call it. This script is suppose to complete the mission and
  call `gsh check`.
  This is useful for testing purposes, but also if using `gsh pass` is not
  sufficient. For example, the mission might ask to create a directory. `gsh
  auto` should ensure it is created correctly.
  Just like `gsh pass` and `gsh goto N`, this command will first ask for a
  password.

* `gsh index`: this will display the list of available missions, with there
  status. If you've used `pass` and `goto` a lot, this might come in handy.

The other commands are either self-explanatory (`gsh welcome`) or only useful
while creating missions (`gsh assert ...`, `gsh test`).



Creating an executable archive
------------------------------

The script `bin/archive.sh` is used to create an executable archive to
distribute a (customized) version of GameShell.

By default, it creates an archive with all the missions listed in the
`missions/index.txt` file and with all the translations available.

You can customize the archive with the following options

* `-A` : make the archive default to the "anonymous" mode. This is the
  default.
* `-P` : make the archive default to the "passport" mode. For each new game,
  GameShell will ask for the player's name and email. This is useful in the
  classroom as it makes it easier to link a game to the corresponding student.
  (The player can run the archive in anonymous mode with the `-A` option.)
* `-p PASSWORD`: you can choose the admin password for the archive. This is
  also useful in the classroom as we might now want the students to learn of
  this password. :)
* `-a`: keep the automatic scripts. Some missions come with a script that
  automagically completes the missions. By default, those scripts are **not**
  included in the archive. Use `-a` if you want to keep them.
* `-N NAME`: if you want the archive and its directory to be called something
  different than "GameShell", you can set the name with this option.
* `-k`: keep the GameShell archive. The compressed `tar` archive is appended
  to a `bash` script to create the executable archive. With this option, you
  can keep the "standard" `tar` archive as well as the executable one. (I'm
  not sure why you would want to keep it though.)
